abstract:  "The control device, which operates due to a processor executing an object-oriented program, backs-up, to a storing section, respective first combinations of elements of a first object in which class structure relating to an application program is defined, and respective second combinations of elements of a second object in which class structure relating to a storage region used by an application program is defined. In a case in which generation of an object is necessary when the program is started, for the first object, the control device reads-out the respective first combinations from the storing section and generates the fist object, and, for the second object, the control device reads-out the respective second combinations from the storing section and generates the second object."
